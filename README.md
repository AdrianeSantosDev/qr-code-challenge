## Overview

This project is easy. I could do it while pulling an all-nighter. Honestly, the hardest part was centering the div. It seems like I'm always relearning how to do that all over again.

## My process

First, I created the HTML and set up the divs and text. Then, I used colors to create variables in the CSS file. I did stumble a bit with the font size, though.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

How to center a div (again)
